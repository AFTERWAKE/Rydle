    Rydle is a game where you try to guess what year a specific event took place.<br><br>

    For each guess each number will get one of three results. <br><br>

    <strong>Green:</strong> The digit is correct<br>
    <strong>Yellow:</strong> The digit appears in the answer but in the incorrect location<br>
    <strong>Black:</strong> The digit does not appear in the answer<br><br>

    Try to find the year the event took place as quick as you can!
